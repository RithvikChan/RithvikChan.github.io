       Hi, I'm Rithvik Chandan! I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at PES University, India. I like using technology to find solutions for everyday problems and empower people to do their best. I also have a craze for efficiency and am always looking out to make things (including technology) much more efficient!

      <p>
        I love music and enjoy playing the bass guitar for my band, Sentient Cheeseburger, at the Octavium Insitute of Music, Bengaluru. Check out some of my music on my <a class="about_me_links" href="/hobbies">hobbies</a> section. I also love playing cricket and actively follow the Indian cricket team and Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League.
